### A RAG based chatbot to help diagnose and resolve problems with trucks
Although my primary responsibility at Nikola was to drive the strategy and program for ADAS, the project that was more consequential as development of a chatbot to help troubleshoot trucks.  As I attended calls and meetings, what struck me was that there are a number of Jira projects created by different groups (e.g. development, quality, manufacturing,...  seven in total) and number of other databases that housed information on existing experience with the fleet.  However, these projects were very poorly maintaned.  

The tendency of the team was to create a new Jira project, port some tickets from existing projects to help with truck diagnosis.  My hypothesis was that we needed to salvage any information that was captured, and if the tickets were poorly maintained, then one could use LLMs to fill in the holes.  As an example, Jira tickets had fields for problem, root cause, interim solution, long term solution, but these fields were routinely left blank.  Instead, the comments on the tickets would hold infomation on such items.  

I used openAI to scrape all the jira projects, as well as other database, to produce a table that essentially held "problem", "Cause", and "Solution", for each logged ticket.  I then combined "problem", and "cause" fields and produced a vector that was stored on Pinecone, a vector database.

### Chatbot concept 
Once the Pinecone database was created, I used the pipeline structure below to develop a pipeline for a RAG based chatbot.

### User Interface
Although initially, I had used Jupyter notebook to implement the chatbot, for better affect I developed a very simply Flask application that allowed me to surface a UI that would be similar to what a user would expect from a chatbot.

### Sample Output
Below you can see a sample output.  Given a question, the chatbot would come up with potential causes, reference existing tickets and vehicles where the problem was observed.  I got sample questions from the maitnenance team, and the results were suprisingly good.

### Aftermath
The tool was considered a priority, and I was asked to implement the chatbot given Nikola's current AWS framework.  I ported my database to a Postgres database, and instead of OpenAI I used anthropic to implement the chatbot.

I also used the vectorized database to do an analysis of current problems faced by Nikola in an attempt to develop a prioritized list of target areas.
