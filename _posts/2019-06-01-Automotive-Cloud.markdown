<br>
My first responsibility at Harman was to manage the Ignite Automotive Cloud Platform.  This was a 400 person team.  

<br>
<br>

The solution allowed abstraction of the car in the cloud, to allow rapid development of cloud based applications.  
<br>
<br>

At time of arrival, three separate groups were developing elements of a product, but lack of leadership had resulted in a number of problems.  First priority was to baseline and agree to a common architeture view, and then cherry pick technologies developed by the groups to be merged into a single branch, and then agree to a roadmap that allowed us to hit a minimal viable product.  

<br>
<br>
Placed focus on establishig a development process that allowed a streamlined development activity.
<br>
<br>
The product was selected by Fiat Chrysler Automobilites (FCA) within the first year of development.  It was depoyed in US, the EU, asia and China.  For deployment in China, led negotiations with Chinese cloud and service produce to first secure the licneses necessary for operating the service in China, and second a suitable replacement of AWS cloud. 
<br>
<br>
Additional customers included Audi and BMW, the application was more limited in scope.  The primary target for these customers were deployment of connected navigation applications.
