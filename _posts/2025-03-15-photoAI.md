### Project Overview
In this class we have seen how Generative models can be used in Computer Vision. We have also seen how to use the Segment Anything Model to select subjects in images by providing points and other inputs.

Let's put some of this knowledge to good use by building something interesting, and fun!

### Project Summary
This project implements a little app that allows you to select a subject and then change its background, OR keep the background and change the subject.

The process involves a user uploading an image and selecting the main object by clicking on it. The Segment Anything Model (SAM) is activated to create a mask around the selected object, choosing the most accurate mask generated. The user is shown this result to either accept it or refine the mask further with additional points.

Once the mask is finalized, the user gives a text description (and possibly a negative prompt) to specify a new background for the selected object. An infill model then creates this new background, and the final image is displayed. Optionally, the user can choose to invert the mask and substitute the subject while keeping the background, as in the example above.

The app can be used to swap backgrounds, swap subjects, remove objects, etc.

There is a file in github repository that has some samples of the output of the app.  Below is a sample.  Note that two options, where the selected item is kept, and a new background is generated using Gen AI, or conversely, the seleted item is taken away.
