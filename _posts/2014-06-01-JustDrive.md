### justDrive
Managed the engineering team that Delivered a projected automotive experience at Jaguar Landrover, an early example of voice first experience. Developed requirements that allowed transition of a demo to a commercial grade service. Drove development of standalone validation tests
to expedite integration with Nuance, Bosch, and HERE SDKs.
The project was a big success, with JLR customers indicating the projected experience was superior to the embedded experience.  This led to creation of a project that led to a $15M investment in CloudCar, and a partnership with LG, to deliver the experience.
