My first porduct responsibility at Harman was the Ignite Cloud Platform.  However early on we discovered the opportunity to launch a product that leveraged the basic core IoT capabilities to deliver an OBD based solution to carriers.  In addition to creating a new revenue stream, the product introductions gave Ignite the opportunity to commercially deploy a solution, and mature the capabilities in time for more critical Automotive launches.

The application offered location based services, vehicle health, geofencing and impact detection to consumers.  The platform also allowed 3rd party service provders to offer fleet solutions.  In the US, AT&T launched the service only 9 months after product developmet launch, and Sprint soon followed with a full complement of features three months later.  The service was also launched with multiple OEMs globally.
