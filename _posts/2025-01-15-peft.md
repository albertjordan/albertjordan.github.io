### Project Description
This project was part of Udacity's Gen AI Engineering Nano Degree program. Lightweight fine-tuning is one of the most important techniques for adapting foundation models, because it allows you to modify foundation models for your needs without needing substantial computational resources.

In this project, brings together all of the essential components of a PyTorch + Hugging Face training and inference process. 

The project:

Loads a pre-trained model and evaluate its performance
Perform parameter-efficient fine tuning using the pre-trained model
Perform inference using the fine-tuned model and compare its performance to the original model
