### Interactive User Manual
Having learned a few things about chatbots, I decided to do a fun project.  For me, one problem I have when driving a new car is seeing telltale signs in the dashboard, and not knowing what they are.  I wanted to do a chatbot that would address this pain point but also wanted to incorporate images.

Picture below depicts the data processing piece of the project.  I scraped the vehicle user manual (I did both for Tesla and Lucid Air).  For each page that was scanned, I looked for both images and text. My aim was to generate a vector, for each paragraph enountered.  I would also couple paragraphs before and after an image, and feed the text and the image to openai to come up with a more context aware image caption.  I would generate an embedding for that, and would store both types of vector in a pinecone database.

### Chatbot
The Chatbot piece was not difficult, except that I had to account for processing both images and text, and ensure that the images followed relevent text.
