In 2018, as the market was adopting Android, saw an opportunity for a white label Android Automotive App Store, which would allow OEMs to harness the benefits of Android, while maintaining control. Forged early partnerships with likes of HERE and

Implmented a "Rolling Thunder" PR strategy by successfuly onboarding marquee App providers such as

Zoom, and The Weather Channel to compel development of new applications for automotive.  


<br>
<br>
