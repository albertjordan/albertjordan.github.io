### Self Driving Car Engineering Nano Degree

The Self Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree program at Udacity is designed to provide you with the skills and knowledge necessary to work on autonomous vehicles. You will learn about the various components that make up self-driving technology, including computer vision, deep learning, sensor fusion, localization, and control systems. The program combines theoretical knowledge with practical projects, allowing you to apply what you've learned in real-world scenarios.

### Key Skills Taught:
* 1D and 2D object localization
* A* search algorithm
* Automated path planning
* Computer vision techniques
* Deep learning and neural networks
* Sensor selection and integration
* Kalman filters and localization techniques
* Object detection and tracking

### Projects:
The program typically includes the following projects:

* CarND Term1 Starter Kit: Set up your development environment and get familiar with the tools and libraries used in the program.

* Traffic Sign Recognition: Build a model to detect and classify traffic signs using computer vision techniques.

* Lane Detection: Implement a lane detection algorithm that identifies lane boundaries in images from the car's camera.

* Behavioral Cloning: Train a deep learning model to drive a car by mimicking human driving behavior based on video input.

* Advanced Lane Finding: Enhance your lane detection project to handle more complex scenarios, such as curved lanes and variable lighting conditions.

* Object Detection: Use deep learning techniques to detect and classify objects in images, such as pedestrians and other vehicles.

* Sensor Fusion: Combine data from multiple sensors (e.g., cameras, Lidar, radar) to improve the accuracy of the vehicle's perception.

* Path Planning: Implement algorithms to plan a safe and efficient path for the vehicle to follow in a simulated environment.

* Final Project: Integrate all the skills and knowledge you've gained throughout the program to create a comprehensive self-driving car system that can navigate a complex environment.
