### Modular Head Unit Concept
CloudCar CTO had proposed a novel approach to architecting a head unit.  The thought was that the main pain point for OEMs was ensuring the in car experience was on par with consumer's phone experience.  But whereas consumers switch phones every 2 or 3 years, the lifespan of a vehicle is much longer.

CloudCar's proposal was to divide the head unit into two components: a baseband, and a compute module.  The baseband included elements that were constant with time.  For example, tuners, amplifiers were items that were basically constant with time.  On the other hand, the compute fabric needed to kep pace with mohr's law.

I convinced NVIDIA to design a Tegra 3 compute fabric for cloud car. I led prototype design and implementation
of a 1-DIN head unit prototype, with replaceable display and compute elements

I used an off the shelf 1-DIN am/fm radio as the base band, and came up with a 2-DIN solution that could be insalled in vehicles.  I installed the solution in 20 cars. Below, the picture of a modular head unit in my Sienna van.
