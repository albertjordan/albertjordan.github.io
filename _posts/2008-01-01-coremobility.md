### Mobile Applications at Scale
Prior to iPhone launch in 2007, the wireless industry struggled with delivering compelling applications to consumers.  I worked at Core Mobility, which was one of handful companies that was able to deploy applications on consumer grade wireless feature phones.

<br><br>
I started with leading the product management team, but in time my responsibilities grew to include the management of the handset engineering team, QA, and in a few occasion as leading engineering.  Core Mobilities competency was development of a process that allowed bug-free integration with wireless phone platforms.
<br><br>
The services I delivered were wirlesss backup (which allowed seamless phonebook restoration for lost or new phones), voice messaging, and visual voicemail (experience that is available on iPhone today.)
