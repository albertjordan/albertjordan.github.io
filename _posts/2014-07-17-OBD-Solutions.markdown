OBD based solutions presented a great opportunity for us to mature the ignite platform.  Wireless Carriers were looking to expand services and a number of them submitted RFI/RFPs for such solutions.  
<br>
<br>
Our belief was that such solutions, where a great way to bring the Ingite platform to market in order to mature the lower layers of the stack.  Within 6 month of my arrival we were able to deploy a service at AT&T, though AT&T selected another vendor for the application layer.  

We also were able to secure Sprint as a customer, and within an additional 3 months we were able to complete the application layer.  Ultimaely we also secured the application layer at AT&T.

The solution was also some OEMs to deploy services in terrirotries that were not deemed a priorty.
